# atca-rapid-response-api: Python library

The documentation for this library is made up primarily of examples of how to use
it to make actual requests. There is also a [reference page](docs/reference.md)
which is meant as a comprehensive list of library methods and properties.

We suggest that you look through the examples first to get a feel for how the
library is intended to be used.
